    "## 1 **Factiva Article Dataset Construction**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 **Purpose:** This code takes html-formatted articles from Factiva search results and iteratively converts the html to pandas dataframes and then appends each dataframe of articles (df2) to a mother dataframe (df). It also shows post-hoc clean up of df, such as removing duplicate articles and oddly formatted quotation marks. The finished df is then fed into a different Python project that extracts and attributes quotes and paraphrases from decisions makers within these articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 **Input data:** I took the list of firms from my corporate dataset from Pitchbook and filtered out all the automakers. I then created Factiva search quiries with the following steps: \n",
    "##### Step 1 - I took the base \"Executive quotes\" search code and removed the XXX filters and added some \"said equivalents\" based on YYY and add varients of the name of the focal automaker as well as the date range of 1/1/90 to 3/X/2021.\n",
    "##### Step 2 - I ran these searches for each automaker and saw how many hits were in each year. \n",
    "##### Step 3 - Factiva does not let you scrape their website. It also only lets you download a report of 100 articles at a time so I had to carefully go through each firm-year with over 100 articles and break up search date ranges to get as close to 100 as possible. I also combined years to equal as close to 100 as possible. Ultimately there were over 5,000 searches. \n",
    "##### Step 4 - I then ran each of these 5,000+ searches manually, downloading each search result in RTF format. As part of this manual process I would run a Python code to move the downloaded file and rename it to a folder of choice. I did this with two everything (screens, Factiva, tracking, renaming Python code, etc.) to speed up the process. \n",
    "##### Step 5 - I reran Step 1 - 4 but changing the roles references to middle manager-type titles. \n",
    "##### Step 6 - I merged the articles from Step 4 and Step 5 to arrive at 270,193 unique articles (about 70K more than with the initial Step 1-4) \n",
